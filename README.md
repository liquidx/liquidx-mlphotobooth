# ML Photo Booth

This is a tech demo using the Tensorflow Face Landmark Detection models to create 
a simple rendering of the mesh generated in real time and orientated it into the
same direction no matter which way you turn.

# Structure 

 * `index.hbs` is just a plain generic container for the demo. 
 * `mlphotobooth.hbs`, `mlphotobooth.js` and `mlphotobooth.scss` is the implementation.
